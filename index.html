                        Curious. Disciplined. Kind. Those are the three words I would choose to describe myself and the words I would hope you use to remember me. I have always had a ingrained need to figure out how something works. I would take apart clocks growing up and put them back together. I always loved reading how to build things and this has transferred into my growth as a developer. I may not know exactly how to do something when asked but I will the second time. I will spend hours reading documentation and then making small projects to truly understand it. This speaks to my discipline as well, I know that the only thing that bridges talent and results is putting in the hours. I will get the job done no matter how long it takes. I will also take that experience and apply it when the time comes again. But the thing that I am most proud of is the energy and attitude that I can bring to the workplace. I have an affability and kindness that is rare. I have the patience to sit with someone and help them or be helped without an ego. I have an extroversion that acts as a social lubricant that is valuable in a field where introversion runs rampant. I know that I have a lot to offer and I look forward to showing you.
